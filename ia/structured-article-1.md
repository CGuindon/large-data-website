A **comet** is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, displays a visible atmosphere or coma and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many different cultures.
