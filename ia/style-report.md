#Style Report

## Large Data Website â€“ Space

While creating my 3 style tiles I came up with 3 different approaches to layout the identity of the website.  The first is more towards a flat design and has simple illustrations and a bubbly personality.  The colours are neutral and calm with one bright colour as an accent.  The second, comes from a sense of being in space; the majority is dark and black but there are a number of bright white lights.  I used 3 primary colours to keep it clear and consistent and show a high contrast.  The third also shows a high contrast but in the opposite manner. The goal was to have a more sophisticated website that has a main basis of white.  The images from space will be able to stand out more with a white background.

I think the second style tile will work best for my website as it is a mix of the two others, it has some sophistication but also plays on a lighter mood as well.  This will allow for a wider range of viewers to feel at ease while browsing the site.  My target audience are students and teachers from ages 10 to 60 years old.  There shouldn't be anything to difficult to use and the layout should be easy to navigate and research.
