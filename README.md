# Space

Outer space holds a lot a mysterious things that scientist can only imagine to understand. This mystery hub holds a lot of awe inspiring bright lights.

Even though the public always seems to steer towards aliens when the topic of space arises, they are quite a few cool things hanging around up there that most people don't know about.

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

As a child, I've always secretly wanted to became an astronomer. Looking up into space still gives me shivers.
